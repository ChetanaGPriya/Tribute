                *<b><i>Nambi Narayanan</i></b> was born on 12 December 1941 in a Tamil Hindu family in Nagercoil,
                 in the erstwhile Princely state of Travancore (present-day Kanyakumari District).
                 <br><br>
                * He did his Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai.
                <br><br>
                *After studying mechanical engineering in Madurai, Narayanan started his career in 1966 at ISRO as a technical assistant at the
                 Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station. He earned a NASA fellowship and was accepted into Princeton University in 1969.
                 He completed his master's program there in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco. He returned to India
                 with expertise in liquid propulsion at a time when Indian rocketry was still solely dependent on solid propellants.
                 <br><br>
                *In 1974, Societe Europeenne de Propulsion agreed to transfer the Viking engine technology in return for 100 man-years of engineering
                 work from ISRO. This transfer was completed by three teams and Narayanan led the team of fifty-two engineers who worked on 
                 technology acquisition from French. Other two teams worked on indigenizing the hardware in India and establishing the development
                 facilities in Mahendragiri.
                 The first engine, named Vikas, was tested successfully in 1985.
                 <br><br>
                *On 30 November 1994, Narayanan was arrested as part of an investigation of alleged espionage, by a team of Kerala police
                 and Intelligence Bureau officials, based on the videographed statements 
                 by a colleague that he and Narayanan had received money for transferring drawings and documents of rocket engines.
                 <br><br>
                *Narayanan spent 50 days in jail. He claims that officials from the Intelligence Bureau,
                  who initially interrogated him, wanted him to make false accusations against the top brass of ISRO.
                  <br><br>
                *In 2001, the NHRC ordered the government of Kerala to pay him a compensation of ₹ 1 crore. He retired in 2001. 
                  The Kerala High Court ordered 
                  a compensation amount of Rs 10 lakhs to be paid to Nambi Narayanan based on an appeal from NHRC India in September 2012.
                  <br><br>
                *In 2021, Kerala government settled the case filed against it by Narayanan by agreeing to a payment of ₹1.3 crore.
                  <br><br>
                *On 26 January 2019, he was conferred with the<b> Padma Bhushan</b> award by the Government of India for developing the Vikas rocket engine.
